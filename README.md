### A mobile application made to find the perfect job in the video games industry
GamesValley is a mobile application with the purpose of providing video games developers and future video games developers with a tool to find a job in the industry.
This project is made by Albert Cayuela Naval, a student of the Video Games Design And Development Degree at CITM (Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya).

## Application funcitonalities
In GamesValley there are two types of users, devs and companies. When you sign up, you can do it as one of these two, having therefore, the functionalities of the type you chose.

### Devs funcitonalities

As a dev, the main functionality of the application is to browse through the offers companies uploaded. 
Those offers are shown from newest to oldest and you can apply filters in order to make your search more efficient. You can filter the offers by field of the job (programmer, artist...), by country or by type of job (full-time, part-time...).
Once you see an offer you like, you can tap on it and you will navigate to a more detailed screen, where you are going to find all the information the company provided when the offer was created.
You can apply to an offer in two different ways, first one: with your profile information (companies will see your profile information, which I will explain soon), second one: you can apply with your own .pdf cv (companies will see the cv as you uploaded it).
As a dev you also have your profile, which is going to be used basically to fulfill personal information and professional background in order to have a 'cv' to apply to the offers. This information is: name, surname, email, phone number, profile picture, working experience, studies and languages. Each one of these types of information can be deleted and you cann add more new information whenever you want.

### Companies functionalities

As a company, you have the main functionality of uploading offers to the database. Your offers will be shown to every user. In order to upload an offer you have to provide the next information (title, country, work field, annual salary(optional), currency of payment(optional), type of job, requirements, worker duties, extra information(optional)).
Once you have at least an offer uploaded you can check at any time who applied to the offers you uploaded. You only need to tap on an offer and you will navigate to an applicants screen where you are going to see a list of the people that applied to your offer, when you tap on anyone, you will navigate to his/her information, which is going to be either their profile information or their own cv, depending on the way they chose to apply.
The offers you uploaded can be deleted at any time but they cannot be edited, since people that applied have 'agreed' with you to the initial offer.
You also have a profile, where you can edit your company description and your profile picture (which will be displayed in your offers).
