## Application funcitonalities
In GamesValley there are two types of users, devs and companies. When you sign up, you can do it as one of these two, having therefore, the functionalities of the type you chose.

### Devs funcitonalities

As a dev, the main functionality of the application is to browse through the offers companies uploaded. 
Those offers are shown from newest to oldest and you can apply filters in order to make your search more efficient. You can filter the offers by field of the job (programmer, artist...), by country or by type of job (full-time, part-time...).
Once you see an offer you like, you can tap on it and you will navigate to a more detailed screen, where you are going to find all the information the company provided when the offer was created.
You can apply to an offer in two different ways, first one: with your profile information (companies will see your profile information, which I will explain soon), second one: you can apply with your own .pdf cv (companies will see the cv as you uploaded it).
As a dev you also have your profile, which is going to be used basically to fulfill personal information and professional background in order to have a 'cv' to apply to the offers. This information is: name, surname, email, phone number, profile picture, working experience, studies and languages. Each one of these types of information can be deleted and you cann add more new information whenever you want.
